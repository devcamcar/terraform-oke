# Terraform Module for Oracle Kubernetes Engine

This module is used to deploy a managed Kubernetes cluster using the OKE service on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

Once the cluster is provisioned, the Kubernetes configuration file will be written to the current directory and
can then be moved as needed, usually to ~/.kube/config.
